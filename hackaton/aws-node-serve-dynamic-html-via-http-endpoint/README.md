# Serving Dynamic HTML via API Gateway Example

This example illustrates how to hookup an API Gateway endpoint to a Lambda function to render HTML on a `GET` request.

## Use-cases

- Landing pages for marketing activities
- Single use dynamic webpages

## How it works

Instead of returning the default `json` from a request, you can display custom dynamic HTML by setting the `Content-Type` header to `text/html`.

```js
const response = {
  statusCode: 200,
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "text/html",
  },
  body: html,
};
// callback will send HTML back
callback(null, response);
```

## Deploy

In order to deploy the endpoint simply run

```bash
serverless deploy
```

The expected result should be similar to:

```bash
Deploying serve-dynamic-html-via-http to stage dev (us-east-1)

âœ” Service deployed to stack serve-dynamic-html-via-http-dev (113s)

endpoint: GET - https://XXXXXXXXXXX.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/landing-page
functions:
  landingPage: serve-dynamic-html-via-http-dev-landingPage (466 B)
```

## Usage

You can now send an HTTP request directly to the endpoint using a tool like curl

```bash
curl https://XXXXXXXXXXX.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/landing-page?name=Nik%20Graf
```

The expected result should be similar to:

```bash
<html>
  <style>
    h1 { color: #73757d; }
  </style>
  <body>
    <h1>Landing Page</h1>
    <p>Hey Nik Graf!</p>
  </body>
</html>%
```

Of course you can visit the URL in your browser and this is how it should look like:

To greet a specific person, provide the query parameter with the name of that person e.g. `?name=Nik%20Graf`. The response should now contain the provided name:

## Scaling

By default, AWS Lambda limits the total concurrent executions across all functions within a given region to 100. The default limit is a safety limit that protects you from costs due to potential runaway or recursive functions during initial development and testing. To increase this limit above the default, follow the steps in [To request a limit increase for concurrent executions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/concurrent-executions.html#increase-concurrent-executions-limit).
